# NextGIS storage and visualisation support library

## Intro

NextGIS storage and visualisation support library is a C++ library with C, Python 
and Java bindings. The library provides API to optimized vector and raster 
geodata storage, reading and modification (datasource) and maps creation from 
these geodata.

Developer can create many maps with different content (layers, based on geodata 
from datasource) and define different styles. Map can be panned and zoomed, the 
current extent is stored in map context. Map can return rendered images to display 
to user in various graphic interfaces. Rendering is optimised for big amounts of geodata and uses non 
blocking (async) functions. Map spatial reference is Web Mercator.

## Formats

Datasource supports limited input of GDAL vector and raster formats. Supported
vector formats:

 * GeoJSON
 * ESRI Shape file
 * MapInfo Tab
 * KML

Supported raster formats (only in EPSG:3857):

 * GeoTIFF
 * Png 
 * Jpeg

Supported online services:
    
 * WMS (EPSG:3857)
 * WFS
 
Supported tiled services

 * TMS (EPSG:3857, 3395)
 * MVT

## NextGIS Web and NextGIS Online integration

Library also supports NextGIS Web integration: 

 * NGW instance access
 * supported resources listing
 * rendering or loading vector geodata (NGW Json, GeoJSON, MVT, WFS) 
 * rendering or loading raster (WMS, TMS)
 * syncing vector geodata with NGW instance (history tables support)
 * sending tracking data

## Details

During the upload to the internal database (geopackage) the vector geodata is
projected into EPSG:3857 and generalised for several zoom levels (equivalent to 
4, 8, 12 and 16). This is needed for fast drawing on all map scales. For raster data
appropriate overviews generated as well.

The online data is cached for fast access in common place to use from different 
instances of library.

# Usage

The library can be linked from desktop software or used via bindings. There are 
special support scripts for mobile platforms (Android and iOS). See. /opt/android
and /opt/ios folders.

For Android the gradle script includes several support functions and main build 
and copy tasks. Also special Android.mk and application.mk files with linked
libraries and supported ABIs set.

For iOS special Python script *build_framework.py* to build XCode framework.
Special swift file with cast main C types is provided as well.
