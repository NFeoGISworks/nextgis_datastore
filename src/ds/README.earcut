## Earcut

A C++ port of [earcut.js](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut), a fast, [header-only](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut.hpp/blob/master/include/earcut.hpp) polygon triangulation library.

The library implements a modified ear slicing algorithm, optimized by [z-order curve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_curve) hashing and extended to handle holes, twisted polygons, degeneracies and self-intersections in a way that doesn't _guarantee_ correctness of triangulation, but attempts to always produce acceptable results for practical data like geographical shapes.

It's based on ideas from [FIST: Fast Industrial-Strength Triangulation of Polygons](http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~held/projects/triang/triang.html) by Martin Held and [Triangulation by Ear Clipping](http://www.geometrictools.com/Documentation/TriangulationByEarClipping.pdf) by David Eberly.
